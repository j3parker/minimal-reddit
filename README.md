Minimal Reddit
==============

This is a custom front-end to [reddit.com](reddit.com) that is more convenient to use in browsers like w3m. The server is written in node.js and uses the official reddit API.

Usage
-----

* To view (for example) the stories in subreddits "Programming", "TrueReddit" and "SPACEDICKS", navigate to "http://PATH TO WEB APP HERE/programming+truereddit+spacedicks"
* A "----" seperates each thread in a comment page. Searching for that string is a nice way to skip over threads.
